## How to Get Started

  1. Read our [About][1] page to get an understanding of the project. Don&#8217;t sweat it if there aren't things you don't understand right away!
  2. Read the [State of the Network][2] page to see what we are up to!
  3. Come say hi in our chat, [#phillymesh:phillymesh.net][3] 
      * If you are connecting via the [Riot mobile app][4], select _Use custom server options_ (advanced) and set the homeserver to `https://matrix.phillymesh.net`

## What We Need (Right Now)

  * People willing to come up with a plan to flesh out the mesh network, including testing, documenting, and messing with hardware!
  * People with a desire to host/install a physical node (like a router, old computer, or Raspberry Pi that can run 24/7).
  * People with Linux and/or networking knowledge (Don&#8217;t worry BSD sysops, we need and <3 you too).
  * Developers, tinkerers, amateur radio operators, and engineering-types to help build and shape the network.
  * People interested in community outreach; go to local events and spread the word!
  * Community ambassadors, checkout the [**Next Steps** section of the State of the Network page][5].
  * People willing to write grants and request funds to procure hardware for the network.
  * Still reading? We probably need you, too! Come talk to us in the chat and let us know what you're interested in.
