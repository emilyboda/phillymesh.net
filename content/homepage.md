Philly Mesh is a group for people who enjoy experimenting with mesh networking and related decentralized/distributed technologies.

**We are currently running several [Meshtastic](https://meshtastic.org/) nodes in the Greater Philadelphia area. Join the [**US - Philadelphia PA/Delaware Valley** room in the official Meshtastic Discord](https://discord.com/channels/867578229534359593/1280671409995255809) to chat with others in the area.

If you are interested in learning more about Meshtastic and LoRa and are in the area we highly recommend [Iffy Books' Meshtastic 101 Meetups](https://iffybooks.net/series/ðŸ“¡-meshtastic-101/) to get connected and meet others.**

Not limited to 802.11-based networks  (WiFi), Philly Mesh is open for experimentation with low-power wide-area networking such as LoRa and meshing via amateur radio projects such as AREDN. Other areas of interest include routing protocols and practices (such as BGP), overlay networks (such as Tor and Yggdrasil), and other networking-based projects/technologies (such as DNS, or even just networking fundamentals).

Philly Mesh does not have a master goal of constructing a city-wide mesh network, but it would be okay if that were to happen.
