Philly Mesh is a group for people who enjoy experimenting with mesh networking and related decentralized/distributed technologies.

Not limited to 802.11-based technologies (WiFi), Philly Mesh open for experimentation in low-power wide-area networking such as LoRa and meshing via amateur radio projects such as AREDN. Other areas of interest include routing protocols and practices (such as BGP), overlay networks (such as Tor and Yggdrasil), and other networking-based projects/technologies (such as networking fundamentals or DNS).

Philly Mesh does not have a master goal of constructing a city-wide mesh network, but it would be okay if that were to happen.
