I've put together a page on the site to keep track of nodes within the Philly Mesh network. Not all nodes are in, or even around Philadelphia, but they are all managed by the group. Check out the new page, [here][1]!

All nodes currently listed minimally display a name, a location, contact information, and a status indicator that is refreshed at every page load. Additionally, **all of these nodes are available to peer with**, just send a message to the email address listed under the respective node(s)!

Where applicable, each node also lists its hosting provider, along with a referral link if you wish to sign up for any of the hosting services. Nodes may also list both Hyperboria and clearnet services that are publicly available. These can be updated periodically, and announcements will be made for anything new.

Happy meshing!
