Hey all,

I've created a [State of the Network][1] page to summarize what we are doing and how we are doing it. I hope that this is a good compliment to the [About][2] page as well as the [Get Involved][3] page, though there may be some overlap for the time being.

We have received a lot of interest in Philly Mesh this week, and I hope this new page helps provide more information to newcomers.

As always, come [chat with us][4] if you have any questions or want to say hi!
