If you have not heard yet, Adam Longwill of [Meta Mesh](http://www.metamesh.org/) has discovered that TP-Link, a prominent wireless access point vendor, has started to lock down firmware on some of their routers resulting in routers that are difficult or impossible to flash with open firmware such as[OpenWRT](https://openwrt.org/). Ubiquiti, another popular vendor, is also on track to follow suit.
   
You can find a full write-up from Meta Mesh, titled *The Lockdown is Here*, [on their website](http://www.metamesh.org/#%21The-Lockdown-is-Here/ostn2/56c61ec00cf25df9371e8436). It is an important read.
   
Currently on the [BattleMesh](http://battlemesh.org/) mailing list, there are discussions of alternative hardware that can still be used, and even potential plans for small orders of "unlocked" hardware to benefit the community as a whole.
   
As I was planning on getting a low-tier TP-Link device to experiment with, this delays my plans. However, I am looking at hardware from other vendors to continue my work, and hope to provide updates and create new tutorials as soon as I have the ability.
   
Hopefully this issue is only a small speed bump on the road to more accessible wireless mesh networking.
